# Skapi Full Tutorial

Welcome to the complete tutorial project for Skapi.

The tutorial features a web application that allows users to chat, upload posts, and comment, and even provide an AI image generating service via 3rd party API service.

This tutorial focuses on demonstrating the use of Skapi to build a full-fledged application.

The emphasis is on functionality over aesthetics.


## Demo

This tutorial is deployed at [https://tutorial.skapi.com](https://tutorial.skapi.com).

## Pre Requisites

You must change the **service_id** and the **owner_id** values in `service.js` file.
Currently, the values are set to:
  - Service ID: **"ap220wfRHl9Cw2QqeFEc"**
  - Owner ID: **"f8e16604-69e4-451c-9d90-4410f801c006"**

You can retrieve your own service ID and owner ID from your service dashboard.

For more information, please refer to our [Skapi Documentation](https://docs.skapi.com/introduction/getting-started.html).

## Opening the Project

This project does not require any build tools.

Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser, and it will just work.

If you are on remote server, run the following command to host the project:

```bash
npm run start 3000
```
*The number 3000 is the port number. You can change it to any port number you want.*

You will be able to access the project at `http://[your remote server url]:3000`.
